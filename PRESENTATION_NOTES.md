# Notes for presenatation!

## Advantages of Adventure Quiz
- It's engaging for a potential student, they can interact with it and play it like a game,
- It introduces them to a rough structure of a day at Northcoders,
- We can showcase, implicitly, throughout the game what the student can get whilst studying at Northcoders,
- The result is semi-personalised, making it feel meaningful in some way,
- Students will self-qualify themselves as interested in the bootcamp if they put in their email,
- It creates a natural flow for the marketing B2C sales funnel,
- The idea can be extended to Hiring partners too, e.g. What Northcoder would fit best in your organisation,
- Even if a person doens't commit, they will have a positive experience,
- It creates a natural talking point for tutors/marketing to engage the student in a discussion about coding,
- It alleviates pressure off of people who might not want to talk to a person straight off the bat,
- It is reusable as a resource online in many different ways,
- If students do enter an email, they can gain access to more Northcoders content which will keep them focused on Northcoders over a competitor,
- Email's can then be used in email marketing campaigns in the future if the candidate hasn't gone through the bootcamp and then moved to an alumni list once they have for exclusive content after the course
- Content that we send in the first email can be personalised to some degree depending on the final result.
- We can introduce new concepts to applicants sooner than they would've been exposed otherwise,
